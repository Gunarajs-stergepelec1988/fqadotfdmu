OMG so I just finished Squad 36 and like, wow. What even just happened? 😂 I swear, half the time I'm like, Seriously, who writes these plots?! You know what I mean? It's like they just throw the most random people together and say, Hey, make some drama. But you know what? I kinda loved it. Those moments where you're like, Oh no, they didn’t just do that. 

Anyway, the part where that guy totally eats it during the challenge? I didn’t see that coming at all. I almost choked on my popcorn 🤣 And I still can't get over his face when it happened, like dude, same. Props to the team for mixing in those laugh-out-loud plots with seriously intense scenes. Like, thank you for that emotional rollercoaster...

> Bro, I actually had to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   since I missed the showtime and didn’t wanna deal with spoilers on social. Remember that flood of spoiler posts last time?! Yeah, I wasn’t about to let that happen again. 

And let's not even talk about the soundtrack. I mean, it's epic in the cheesiest way, and yet I'm kinda vibing to it. In fairness, a bad soundtrack can ruin even the prettiest   vibe. Good thing they nailed it there. Might even 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just for those beats. 

Anyway, shifting gears, is it just me, or did the villain have kinda a point? Like, I kinda felt bad for them in the end. But maybe I’m just tired and my brain is kinda like, Dude, make it make sense. Ugh, my chaotic brain strikes again.

int main() { return 0; } // What even is this? Why is it in my head? 😂

Man, I should totally crash now, but my mind's racing and I don't think sleep's happening soon. Talk to you tomorrow? Maybe we can pick apart more   madness, lol. Peace out!
